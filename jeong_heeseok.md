# Knockin' on Heaven's Door

 In *Knockin' on Heaven's Door*, after being diagnosed with a terminal illness, two protagonists go through various events together. Eventually, they decide to fulfill one last wish—to see the ocean—and set off on a road trip. While enjoying vodka and cigars, they finally arrive at the long-awaited beach. The two silently gaze out at the sea. Suddenly, the protagonist’s friend suffers a seizure and passes away. The protagonist stares blankly at his friend, then quietly lets him go. The final scene shows the protagonist sitting by the ocean, accepting his own approaching death calmly, a peaceful embrace of mortality, creating a lingering impact. 
 
 The original song was featured in the 1973 film *Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid*, directed by Sam Peckinpah. In film, a cover version by the German rock band, Selig, was used, with greater emphasis on the band's instrumentation and performed in a lower key compared to the original. The first verse is sung solely by the vocalist, and from the second verse onward, a chorus joins in, similar to the original version. In the refrain, the lyrics "knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door..." keeps continue, effectively conveys the protagonist's gradual descent toward death and enhancing the lingering emotion of the ending.
 
Example: The story portrays a narrative similar to [*Bohemian Rhapsody*](kwak_junyeong.md), in that the character continues to suffer from illness but does not despair over their situation. Instead, they persistently strive to achieve their goals without giving up, even if a cure is unattainable.

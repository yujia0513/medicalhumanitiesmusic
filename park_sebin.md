# Keys to the Heart

Savant Syndrome refers to a phenomenon where individuals with mental disabilities demonstrate extraordinary abilities in specific areas. The protagonist, Jin-tae, in the film, is usually clumsy in his behavior and expression of emotions, but he possesses a genius-level talent in playing the piano. Through his ability to express emotions through the piano, Jin-tae shows that people with disabilities should not be viewed as lacking talent. His performance of Piano Concerto No. 1, playing alongside an orchestra, illustrates this point.

Autism, a type of developmental disorder, is depicted in Yoon-chul Chung’s 2005 film [*Marathon*](kim_taehyeong.md). The song “Run, Cho-won” featured in the movie effectively reflects the protagonist’s repetitive and routine-based life. Just as the main character in the film Keys to the Heart, which I wrote about, shows talent in playing the piano, the protagonist of Marathon also demonstrates great talent—specifically in running.

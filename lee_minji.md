# The Fault in Our Stars

[Ed Sheeran’s “All of the Stars”](https://youtu.be/nkqVm5aiC28?si=FbY3yQcVP5zsvo-4) delicately captures the emotions of Hazel, who is left behind after Augustus passes away from cancer in the film The Fault in Our Stars. The song creates an atmosphere of calm and resignation through its repeated, simple melodic line, and in the verses, Sheeran uses a quiet, speech-like vocal style to convey Hazel’s love, the pain of parting, and a faint hope that they might meet again someday. In particular, Hazel comes to understand the depth of Augustus’s love for her through the eulogy he leaves behind, and she does not view his death as mere loss. In the eulogy, Augustus says, “You gave me a forever within the numbered days,” showing that love can transcend death. Through this, Hazel moves beyond sorrow and accepts the love and memories he left her with, internalizing their meaning more deeply. “All of the Stars” does not simply portray the fear of cancer or death itself, but instead expresses, with quiet and emotional sincerity, the complex feelings of loss, love, and continued connection experienced by those left behind. The song goes beyond merely reflecting the character’s emotions—it offers a warm and philosophical message about how we might view death caused by illness.

The 1997 film [*Knockin' on Heaven's Door*](jeong_heeseok.md) does not deal with the same illness, but it delicately portrays the emotions of those left behind facing the death of a loved one due to illness, showing similarities with *The Fault in Our Stars*. Both works view death not simply as a tragedy or an end, but as an extension of love and memory, expressing the process of acceptance through music. In particular, both songs, *Knockin' on Heaven's Door* and *All of the Stars*, use repetitive and emotional melodies to effectively convey the characters’ inner feelings and attitudes toward death.

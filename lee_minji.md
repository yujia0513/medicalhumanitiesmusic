# The Fault in Our Stars

Ed Sheeran’s "All of the Stars" delicately captures the emotions of Hazel, who is left behind after Augustus passes away from cancer in the film The Fault in Our Stars. The song creates an atmosphere of calmness and resignation through the repetitive use of a simple melody, and in the verses, the soft, speech-like singing style conveys Hazel’s love for Augustus, the pain of their farewell, and a small but lingering hope that they might meet again someday. Hazel does not simply grieve Augustus’s death, but rather accepts and understands the love he left behind through his eulogy, deepening her sense of its meaning. Instead of focusing on the fear of death caused by cancer, "All of the Stars" naturally expresses the feelings of loss, love, and ongoing connection experienced by those left behind.

The 1997 film [*Knockin' on Heaven's Door*](jeong_heeseok.md) does not deal with the same illness, but it delicately portrays the emotions of those left behind facing the death of a loved one due to illness, showing similarities with *The Fault in Our Stars*. Both works view death not simply as a tragedy or an end, but as an extension of love and memory, expressing the process of acceptance through music. In particular, both songs, *Knockin' on Heaven's Door* and *All of the Stars*, use repetitive and emotional melodies to effectively convey the characters’ inner feelings and attitudes toward death.

# La traviata

The aria is sung by the protagonist, Violetta, as she faces her approaching death. The lyrics mention a "doctor" and a "serious illness," and Violetta expresses her despair, saying she would rather die than endure such suffering. Verdi conveys her weakening life force and deep hopelessness through a slow tempo and gentle melody. The increasingly thin vocal lines and near-silent pauses delicately portray Violetta’s physical decline and the nearness of death. The music serves as a farewell to the life she once knew.

The expression of a farewell to life through song is similar to the Thea Sharrock’s 2016 film [*Me Before You*](chang_hyomin.md). Imagine Dragons’ song ‘Not Today’ is featured in the farewell scene. Lyrics like ‘And it isn’t over / unless it’s over’ highlight the protagonist’s heartbreaking love.

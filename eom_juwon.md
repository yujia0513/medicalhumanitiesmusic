# La traviata

The protagonist of La Traviata, Violetta, is a famous courtesan in Parisian high society. She falls in love with a noble young man named Alfredo. However, due to Alfredo’s father, Violetta is forced to leave him. Alfredo misunderstands Violetta’s sacrifice and suffers in despair, but eventually learns the truth and returns to her. By then, Violetta has already lost the will to live and is nearing death, and she dies in Alfredo’s arms.

As Violetta sits in front of a mirror and gazes at her emaciated reflection, she begins to bid farewell to life. [*At this moment,*](https://youtu.be/Do4Ei7Cio2g) she sings a regretful aria titled *Addio, del passato*. Violetta sings, *“Addio, del passato … Ah!… tutto, tutto è finito, or tutto, tutto è finito”* (“Ah! Everything is over, now everything is truly over”), expressing her despair. In the latter part of the lyrics, she further reveals her frailty and loneliness by singing, *“Le rose del volto già sono pallenti”* (“The roses of my cheeks have already faded”) and *“Alfredo perfino mi manca”* (“Even Alfredo’s love is gone from me”). This aria musically expresses her resignation and deep despair toward her life. In other words, *Addio, del passato* is a farewell to her once-happy past and the future that can never be.

The expression of a farewell to life through song is similar to the Thea Sharrock’s 2016 film [*Me Before You*](chang_hyomin.md). Imagine Dragons’ song ‘Not Today’ is featured in the farewell scene. Lyrics like ‘And it isn’t over / unless it’s over’ highlight the protagonist’s heartbreaking love.

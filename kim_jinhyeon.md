# La Peste
In the 1940s, when World War II was in full swing, a sudden plague broke out in Oran, a small city on the northern coast of French Algeria, and the city of Orang was cut off from the outside and citizens were isolated accordingly. It philosophically dealt with the existence of human beings, which is revealed as the curtain continues for a year, with dozens or hundreds of people dying a day while isolated from the outside.

It shows what choices humans make in the face of the inevitable catastrophic fate that is facing everyone, centering on the protagonist, Dr. Li and Health University. Not only is it a representative work of existentialist literature, but it is also the beginning of the disaster novel genre in public.

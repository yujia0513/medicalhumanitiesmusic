# My Left Foot
*My Left Foot* is a biographical film based on the life of Christy Brown, a man born with cerebral palsy who was only able to control his left foot. Despite this challenge, he became a celebrated writer and painter. The film delicately portrays his struggles, achievements, and the support of his family.
The soundtrack, composed by Elmer Bernstein, is subtle and emotional, perfectly matching the tone of the film. Music is used not only to reflect Christy’s emotional state, but also to intensify key moments in the story. For instance, when Christy completes his first painting using only his left foot, the music gradually swells, emphasizing the sense of victory and emotional release. This demonstrates how music in the film plays a vital role in connecting the viewer to the character’s inner world.

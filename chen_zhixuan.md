# A Beautiful Mind

This film tells the story of John Nash, a mathematical genius at Princeton University, who proposes groundbreaking theories at a young age. However, as his career flourishes, he begins to suffer from hallucinations and delusions, becoming trapped in a world of his own creation. Nash believes he has been recruited by the government to crack secret Soviet codes, gradually losing the ability to distinguish reality from fantasy. With the support of his family and doctors, he undergoes treatment and, with the unwavering support of his wife Alicia, battles schizophrenia over the years. Eventually, Nash returns to academia and, through his remarkable contributions, is awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, achieving a legendary life of redemption.

The song's monotonous, repetitive piano melody symbolizes protagonist John Nashâ€™s sense of isolation as he becomes trapped in hallucinations and delusions. The dissonance of the strings highlights his chaotic thoughts and mental instability, while the gradual build-up of the music narratively expresses the worsening of his condition.

#  Daily Dose of Sunshine(정신병동에도 아침이 와요)

Gymnopédie No.1 is used repeatedly in scenes featuring Daeun, the main character who is both a nurse and a patient. This musical choice deepens her character and blurs the line between “normal” and “abnormal,” reinforcing the drama’s central message: a warm, equal view of all human beings. Rather than portraying mental illness as mere suffering or a condition to be overcome, the piece—through its simple melody and slow tempo—gently reflects the quiet flow of time and the inner lives of the patients. It helps frame illness not as a tragedy, but as an ordinary part of life. The calmness of the music harmonizes with the atmosphere of the ward, making the viewers feel that even within pain, there is dignity, humanity, and hope.

<Daily Dose of Sunshine(정신병동에도 아침이 와요)> portrays various mental illnesses through each episode. One of the most emotional episodes involves a patient named Seo-wan, who lives with schizophrenia and dies by suicide. This incident deeply affects the main character, Dae-eun, a nurse, and highlights the emotional reality of psychiatric care. The drama visualizes schizophrenia in a way that helps viewers understand the patient's perspective. A similar portrayal appears in the 2014 Korean drama Noh Hee-kyung(노희경)’s 2014년 drama [*It’s Okay, That’s Love(괜찮아 사랑이야)*](yoon_sooim.md), which also features a character with schizophrenia. In that series, the song “Hero” by Family of the Year is used to express both pain and resilience, reinforcing the theme that love and understanding can exist alongside mental illness.

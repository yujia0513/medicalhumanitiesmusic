#  Daily Dose of Sunshine(정신병동에도 아침이 와요)

Gymnopédie No.1 captures the anxiety, sorrow, and hope within the ward through its simple melody and slow tempo. Instead of depicting mental illness solely as suffering, the piece gently reflects the quiet flow of time and inner lives of the patients. It helps the drama present illness not as a tragedy or something to overcome, but as a natural part of daily life. The music often plays when the main character, Daeun—a nurse and also a patient—appears. By doing so, it softens the boundary between “normal” and “abnormal,” reinforcing the drama’s core message: a warm, equal view of all human beings.

<Daily Dose of Sunshine(정신병동에도 아침이 와요)> portrays various mental illnesses through each episode. One of the most emotional episodes involves a patient named Seo-wan, who lives with schizophrenia and dies by suicide. This incident deeply affects the main character, Dae-eun, a nurse, and highlights the emotional reality of psychiatric care. The drama visualizes schizophrenia in a way that helps viewers understand the patient's perspective. A similar portrayal appears in the 2014 Korean drama Noh Hee-kyung(노희경)’s 2014년 drama [*It’s Okay, That’s Love(괜찮아 사랑이야)*](yoon_sooim.md), which also features a character with schizophrenia. In that series, the song “Hero” by Family of the Year is used to express both pain and resilience, reinforcing the theme that love and understanding can exist alongside mental illness.

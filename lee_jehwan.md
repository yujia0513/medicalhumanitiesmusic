The Turkish march's characteristic lively and cheerful feeling represents Jin-tae's pure and free perspective on the world and Through the [*Turkish march*](https://youtu.be/HMjQygwPI1c?si=bVuEghC8X-LSoMZr), we are trying to show the disease (Savant syndrome) of Jin-tae (main character) not just a disability, but a different world

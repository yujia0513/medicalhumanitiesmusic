# La Traviata

In La Traviata, Verdi uses gentle, melancholic melodies to depict Violetta’s declining health. Especially in “Addio del passato,” her resignation and suffering are expressed with quiet sorrow, allowing listeners to feel both her physical weakness and emotional isolation. The music, like a fading candle, softly illuminates her final moments with sorrowful beauty.

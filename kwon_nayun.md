# The Fault in Our Stars

“All of the Stars” captures the loss, love, and fear of death felt by the two main characters through its gentle and lyrical melody. Instead of easing the harsh reality of cancer, the lyrics blend hope and farewell, conveying a heartfelt tone that quietly accepts sorrow and seeks to live through it together.

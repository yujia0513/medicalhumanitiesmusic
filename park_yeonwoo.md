# The Fall

Beethoven's *Symphony No. 7, 2nd movement* symbolizes his physical disability and helplessness through its slow, repetitive rhythms. At the same time, the gloomy yet beautiful melodies express his inner turmoil and emotional explosion. The music reflects both the despair he experiences and the hope he seeks through the heroic story he imagines in his fantasies. Thus, the music emotionally underscores Roy's pain and his struggle to break free from it, deeply conveying his psychological state to the audience. Ultimately, the music portrays his disability not just as a physical limitation, but as a complex experience that leads to a journey of mental healing.

# The Theory of Everything

The music [*The Theory of Everything*](https://youtu.be/nMFUkbr7ymY?si=-FtmRNN__DjKrBJ6) delicately captures Stephen Hawking’s journey in coming to terms with the heavy fate of ALS. In particular, Jóhann Jóhannsson’s score makes extensive use of repeated piano arpeggios and layered string textures, which create a sense of both fragility and resilience. These musical elements effectively illustrate the contrast between physical limitation and mental transcendence, highlighting the human spirit’s triumph over adversity.

The film’s main theme, which features a simple, cyclical piano figure, grows in intensity as more strings are gradually added—symbolizing Hawking’s journey from despair to acceptance. This crescendo mirrors the evolution of his life, showing that even as his body weakened, his mind soared. The music thus functions not merely as background but as a narrative voice that helps the audience experience the struggle and triumph of the human spirit alongside Hawking.

This film [*To kill a Mockingbird*](ha_jeonghyeon.md) does not deal with ALS, but it deals with physical disorders, but it is confirmed that it is a disorder related to the nervous system in common, so the content will also be helpful in dealing with the disease I described.

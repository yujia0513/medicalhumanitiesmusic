# The Theory of Everything

In The Story of Everything, soft and lyrical music simultaneously expresses Stephen Hawking's gradually deteriorating physical condition and the strong spirit against it. In particular, Arrival of the birds plays a role in deeply conveying emotions even in the moment of silence, and expresses the message that his body slowly collapses due to disease, but his inner mind is still extending toward the universe through music. Delicate string instruments and calm melodies simultaneously allow us to feel the beauty of the human will to overcome the limits of the body and the despair caused by the obstacles behind it, and I think this symbolically shows that the disability he is experiencing is not just pain or despair, but a process of constant self-overcoming. If you dig deep, you can also feel the sorrow and longing for his young life with a healthy body, and you can also feel his will to accept himself, which has changed outrageously from the past, and to focus on what he can do now.

Similarly, Ludovico Einaudi's Fly in the movie [*Untouchable*](heo_taeyoung.md) highlights a character who does not give in to disability and despair, but overcomes it and pioneers his own destiny. When Fly comes out, the main characters are free to drive through the city in wheelchairs, further emphasizing the happiness that can be found in their present form regardless of disability. By doing so, the director avoided depicting disability as an object of compassion or sympathy, but rather used it as a tool to support the noble and powerful spirit of man who proudly accepts it.

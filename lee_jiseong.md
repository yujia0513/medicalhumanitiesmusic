# The Theory of Everything

In "The Story of Everything," the soft and lyrical music, particularly [Arrival of the Birds](https://youtu.be/pZ3b1a2OnhQ?si=2otX7fEQaoIl-DtL) simultaneously conveys Stephen Hawking's gradually deteriorating physical condition and his strong spirit against it, deeply expressing emotions even in moments of silence by suggesting his inner mind extends toward the universe through sound even as his body slowly collapses due to disease, with delicate string instruments and calm melodies allowing us to feel both the beauty of the human will to overcome the limits of the body and the despair caused by the obstacles behind it, symbolically showing that his disability isn't just pain or despair but a process of constant self-overcoming—a sentiment also revealed in his words, "However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeeded at. Where there is hope."—while also deeply conveying sorrow and longing for his young, healthy life, and his will to accept his outrageously changed self and focus on what he can do now, ultimately delivering a message of profound human resilience.


Similarly, Ludovico Einaudi's Fly in the movie [*Untouchable*](heo_taeyoung.md) highlights a character who does not give in to disability and despair, but overcomes it and pioneers his own destiny. When Fly comes out, the main characters are free to drive through the city in wheelchairs, further emphasizing the happiness that can be found in their present form regardless of disability. By doing so, the director avoided depicting disability as an object of compassion or sympathy, but rather used it as a tool to support the noble and powerful spirit of man who proudly accepts it.

# Marathon

This piece of music embraces Choi-won's innocence and persistent spirit with a bright and uplifting atmosphere, reaching out to the audience. In particular, the repetitive melody and ascending harmonies metaphorically depict Choi-wonâ€™s gradual process of connecting with the world. The music serves not as a portrayal of disability as a flaw to be overcome, but as a gateway to revealing the unique world Choi-won possesses.

For example This Flim is also a good representation of a characteristic of people with autism, which is that they feel calmer when they do one repetitive activity [Rain Man](ahn_ire.md).

# My Annoying brother

Director Kwon Soo-kyung’s film My Annoying Brother (2016) tells the story of Ko Doo-young (played by Do Kyung-soo), a promising national judo athlete who loses his sight in an accident, and his estranged older brother Ko Doo-sik (played by Cho Jung-seok), who is released from prison to become Doo-young’s legal guardian. The film explores the emotional journey of the two brothers as they move from conflict and resentment to reconciliation and deep familial love.

[In one of the film's most memorable scenes](https://youtu.be/qX9EOm06Ybc?si=Jq-kcLB0wy9dkQ0Q), In the latter part of the film, Doo-sik and Doo-young overcome years of misunderstanding and emotional distance. In a symbolic and heartwarming scene, the brothers dance samba together, releasing past wounds and rediscovering their bond. The background music, “Oh! Brother,” is a piece of film score that blends cheerful rhythms with warm, affectionate tones. Its uplifting melody underscores the emotional shift, highlighting themes of forgiveness and familial connection. The song’s light, optimistic mood mirrors the joy and renewed trust between the brothers, making the moment feel both intimate and hopeful.

The same disease is described in Song Manjae's early 19th century film [*Simcheongga*](ahn_ryeogyeong.md). This emotional arc parallels that of the traditional Korean pansori Simcheongga, compiled by Song Manjae in the early 19th century. In Simcheongga, the blind father, Sim Bong-sa, is eventually reunited with his daughter Sim Cheong, whose sacrifice brings about healing and joy. Just as Sim Cheong’s return restores her father’s sight and their relationship, the samba scene in My Annoying Brother represents a modern reflection of the same core themes—disability, sacrifice, reunion, and love. Through its modern setting and emotional music, the film reinterprets timeless Korean values of family, endurance, and reconciliation, bridging the past and present in a touching and meaningful way.

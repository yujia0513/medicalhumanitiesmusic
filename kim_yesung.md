# My Annoying brother

In the latter part of the movie, Ko Doo-sik (Cho Jung-seok) and his younger brother Ko Doo-young (Do Kyung-soo) overcome long-standing conflicts and restore their true brotherhood. In this scene, the two dance samba together, dispel misunderstandings and wounds, and truly understand each other. The "Oh! Brother" playing in the background music is a cheerful yet warm melody that emphasizes reconciliation and love between the brothers

The same disease is described in Song Manjae's early 19th century film [*Simcheongga*](ahn_ryeogyeong.md). The emotional arc in Simcheongga—from tragedy to reunion and joy—mirrors the scene where Ko Doo-sik and Ko Doo-young reconcile after years of conflict. Just as Sim Cheong’s return heals her blind father, the brothers’ samba dance symbolizes forgiveness and restored bonds. The cheerful song “Oh! Brother” adds warmth, much like the festive tone in Simcheongga’s second half. This scene serves as a modern reflection of traditional themes like family, sacrifice, and reconciliation.

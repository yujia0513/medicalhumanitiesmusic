# Let Me Eat Your Pancreas

 [Mr.Children’s “Himawari”](https://youtu.be/Ru2k4pRT8WE?si=vVC5oCmQu2BRDTQY) is the theme song of the film I Want to Eat Your Pancreas. It delicately captures the complex emotions of Haruki, the protagonist, as he faces the impending farewell with Sakura. The song is especially impactful in the scene where Haruki, after Sakura's death, comes to understand her true feelings through a letter she left behind—leaving a lasting impression on the audience. Musically, the song begins with a gentle piano and string arrangement, gradually building in intensity with the addition of drums and guitar in the latter half, mirroring the emotional crescendo. The subtle yet expressive vocals are also key to conveying the sincerity of the song's message. One of the most striking lyrics is: “暗がりで咲いてるひまわり”(“A sunflower blooming in the darkness”) This line draws a comparison between the protagonist's journey of growth after bidding farewell to Sakura, a symbol of spring, and a sunflower.



Example: The similar disease is described in Josh Boone's 2014 film [*The Fault in Our Stars*](lee_minji.md). The film Ed Sheeran's hit song "All of the Stars"

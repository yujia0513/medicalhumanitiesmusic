# Love in the Big City

"The Love Law of a Big City" is a drama that explores the complexities of love, identity, and illness within a modern urban setting. In the story, the protagonist, Go-Young, is diagnosed with HIV. HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a viral infection that primarily targets and weakens the body's immune system by destroying CD4 T-cells, making the body vulnerable to various infections and diseases. Due to the emotional difficulty associated with directly acknowledging the illness, he refers to it as "Kylie," named after the pop star Kylie Minogue. [This is ironically linked to the very origin of his illness, as it was the song his ex-boyfriend was listening to when he transmitted the virus.](https://youtu.be/FAYCftyvVAg?si=vEXjja-HYzflOLrL) This approach reflects his effort to normalize the condition within his life, demonstrating a mindset focused on integration rather than avoidance. Symbolically, by choosing Kylie—a figure celebrated in the LGBTQ+ community as an icon of hope and resilience—Go-Young frames his diagnosis not solely as a source of suffering, but as something that can coexist with strength and renewal. His decision to name his illness after a vibrant pop star mirrors his refusal to be defined by his diagnosis, transforming a medical condition into a narrative element of personal resilience. This metaphorical naming also draws a parallel to Kylie Minogue's own journey of overcoming adversity, particularly her battle with cancer, intertwining her musical narrative of survival with his personal struggle for acceptance.

The film [*Bohemian Rhapsody*](kwak_junyeong.md) portrays the devastating impact of AIDS, a disease caused by infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). As the story unfolds, the protagonist Freddie Mercury—lead vocalist of Queen—grapples with the physical and emotional toll of the illness. Though the film does not explicitly state his diagnosis until later in the narrative, it subtly captures the isolation, fear, and vulnerability associated with AIDS. One of the most powerful moments in the film is Queen's 1985 Live Aid performance, which becomes a symbolic act of defiance and transcendence.

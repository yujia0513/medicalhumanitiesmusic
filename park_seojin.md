# My brilliant life

In the film, the music does not portray the protagonist’s progeria (a rare premature aging disease) in an overtly tragic manner. Instead, it uses delicate and calm melodies to express the fleeting nature of life and the pure emotions of the young boy. Rather than mourning his condition, the music quietly supports Ah-reum's short but beautiful life, allowing the audience to focus on the value of living rather than the sadness of his disease.

[*In the scene where Ah-reum sees the ocean*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4HFSlYNujk) for the first time—a lifelong dream—the soft piano and gentle string arrangement of Song For Life fills the background. As Ah-reum gazes out at the vast sea, the music overlaps with his expression, emphasizing not his illness but his dreams and emotions as a living, breathing human being. In this moment, the music helps lift the frame of “sickness” and portrays Ah-reum’s spirit, evoking quiet inspiration and lingering emotion in the audience, rather than


Both [*Daily Dose of Sunshine*](yoon_soi.md) and My Brilliant Life explore illness not as a tragic limitation but as a meaningful part of human existence. Rather than portraying mental illness or progeria in a sorrowful or dramatic way, both works use quiet, reflective music to highlight the emotional depth and dignity of the individuals at their center. In Daily Dose of Sunshine, Gymnopédie No.1 gently accompanies the inner struggles of patients and the main character, Daeun, suggesting that mental health challenges are not abnormal, but simply part of life. Similarly, in My Brilliant Life, Song for Life enhances the beauty of Ah-reum’s dreams and moments of joy, moving the audience’s focus away from his rare disease and toward his vitality and spirit. In both cases, music plays a subtle yet powerful role in humanizing the characters, shifting attention from their conditions to their emotional experiences. Ultimately, these works reject the binary of “normal” and “abnormal,” instead embracing a warm, inclusive view of humanity. They invite the viewer to understand illness not as something to pity or overcome, but as one of many forms of human life deserving of respect and empathy.

 # Copying Beethoven
 At the time of composing the [Ninth Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbWmav17OEA), Beethoven was almost completely deaf.
He struggled with isolation and frustration, yet his creative spirit remained strong.
Despite his condition, he composed entirely through inner hearing and determination.​
 
 In Copying Beethoven, the film portrays the process of Beethoven composing his Ninth Symphony, particularly focusing on the inclusion of the choral finale. This symphony, known as the "Choral Symphony," is renowned for being the first to incorporate vocal soloists and a choir into a symphonic structure, a groundbreaking innovation at the time.

Both A [*Silent Voice*](Lim_seokhyeon) and Copying Beethoven center on characters who are deaf, using this condition not just as a physical trait, but as a powerful metaphor. In A Silent Voice, Shoko’s deafness symbolizes emotional isolation and the social barriers that prevent genuine connection. In Copying Beethoven, Beethoven’s deafness contrasts with the beauty of the music he creates, highlighting how inner expression can transcend physical limitation. In both stories, deafness challenges communication but also deepens it—forcing others to truly listen, not with their ears, but with empathy and understanding.

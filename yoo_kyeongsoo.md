 # Copying Beethoven
 At the time of composing the Ninth Symphony, Beethoven was almost completely deaf.
He struggled with isolation and frustration, yet his creative spirit remained strong.
Despite his condition, he composed entirely through inner hearing and determination.â€‹
 
 In Copying Beethoven, the film portrays the process of Beethoven composing his Ninth Symphony, particularly focusing on the inclusion of the choral finale. This symphony, known as the "Choral Symphony," is renowned for being the first to incorporate vocal soloists and a choir into a symphonic structure, a groundbreaking innovation at the time.

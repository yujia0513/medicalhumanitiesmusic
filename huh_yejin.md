# Belle : The Dragon and the Freckled Princess

 According to the definition described in ICD11, Social Anxiety Disorder is characterised by marked and excessive fear or anxiety that consistently occurs in one or more social situations such as social interactions (e.g. having a conversation), doing something while feeling observed (e.g. eating or drinking in the presence of others), or performing in front of others (e.g. giving a speech).
 
 This animated film is about a story of a female protagonist who is traumatized by the loss of her mother in an accident as a child. In the movie she overcomes her trauma by singing in front of people under the mask of anonymity in a virtual world called U. It's also a coming-of-age story that shows how she overcomes all of that by shedding her anonymity and singing, exposing herself in front of people to save a child who is being abused.
 The song [“A Million Miles Away”](https://youtu.be/UaZrspJ7eVY?si=SFAFhkcIqjb3qbv8) is featured in the beginning of the movie and in the middle of the movie. In the beginning of the movie, the main character, who wanted to sing but suffers from social anxiety disorder, is shown panicking when kids at school ask her to sing at a karaoke bar. Later, on the way home, she is shown tormented by his inability to sing and tries to sing a song she wrote, “A Million Miles Away”, but is unable to get it right. However, later in the movie, she is shown to have overcome her disability to some extent behind a mask of anonymity. After she became more confident, she reveals herself(by unmasking anonymity) to sing the song, "A Million Miles Away" for an abused boy (the dragon). This song from the beginning of the movie is used as a device to show the main character's disability. However, later in the movie, the song is sung to save an abused boy, and it shows the protagonist struggling to sing without accompaniment, which creates a sense of sadness because the song itself is not sustained. However, later in the movie, the song is sung to save an abused boy, and it shows the protagonist overcoming his disability to some extent for the sake of others and singing in front of people from all over the world. Therefore, the song is sung with an uplifting accompaniment and voice. This shows that the anonymity of the virtual world and the connections made in the virtual world can help someone with a psychological disorder heal. The movie has a similar plot to the movie [*Keys to the heart*](choi_jeongin.md) in terms of a biased view of "overcoming one's disability".

# Everywhere at the end of time

Everywhere at the end of time is a six-part album series created by The Caretaker, centered around the experience of dementia and the gradual deterioration of memory. The album sonically depicts the emotional and psychological decline over time, with each stage representing a different phase of cognitive decay. In Stage 1, nostalgic and warm ballroom music from a distant past plays, lightly distorted by subtle noise and looping to hint at the earliest signs of memory fading. By Stages 2 and 3, the melodies begin to warp and blur, immersing the listener in a growing sense of confusion and cognitive decline. In Stage 4, dissonance and chaotic soundscapes dominate, representing the fragmentation of reality and memory, causing the listener to feel a profound sense of helplessness and disorientation. Stage 5 descends into nearly unrecognizable fragments and overwhelming noise, illustrating the near-total loss of coherent memory where only meaningless remnants remain. Finally, Stage 6 unfolds into near silence and dissolution, capturing the total cognitive collapse and the lonely emptiness left behind at the final stage of dementia.

In order to express mental breakdown, mental illness, confusion, and uncertainty, we can see that many difficult-to-listen-to musics, such as the 12-tone technique that appears in [wozzeck](jang_geunyeong.md), that are outside the existing harmonic system are used. The characteristic of this work that is in contrast to Wozzeck is that it is electronic music, so there is intentional noise and sound.

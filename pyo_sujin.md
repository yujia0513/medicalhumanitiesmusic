# A Beautiful Mind

In A Beautiful Mind, James Horner’s music serves as a crucial tool in portraying John Nash’s schizophrenia. The score delicately reflects Nash’s complex mental state, using sharp, chaotic melodies during moments of confusion and tension, while employing serene and graceful tunes to capture moments of peace and hope. The music goes beyond the background, emotionally unfolding Nash’s inner turmoil and his struggle with the illness, playing a pivotal role in expressing his journey toward recovery.

Example: The same disease is described in Davinci’s 2014 drama [*It’s Okay, That’s Love*](do_gwanwoo.md). The drama Davinci’s hit song “It’s Okay, That’s Love.”

# Bohemian Rhapsody

In the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, Freddie's health is slowly hinted at throughout the film. He coughs and groans, and his face shows fatigue. However, the name AIDS is not directly mentioned in the beginning of the film. In the latter half of the film, Freddie visits a hospital and hears "bad news" from a doctor. This scene is directed quietly and heavily, and although the disease is not specifically mentioned, the reason can be guessed through the sexual orientation of the main character who appears in the middle. Freddie calmly tells the members of Queen that he has a fatal disease and asks them, "Don't pity me." He also affirms his life by saying, "We have to make music together." In both the play and in reality, Freddie chose to create instead of feeling self-pity due to this disease, and instead of revealing his disease, he explosively created and accepted death in his own way. In particular, he revealed his diagnosis to the public the day before his death, showing an attitude of "communicating with actions, not words, with art." 

[The climax of the film, the 1985 Live Aid concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXbqiAZgeCE) actually happened before Freddie actually contracted AIDS, but the film dramatized it to be right after he was diagnosed with AIDS for dramatic effect, showing his determined appearance. So the film creates an emotional atmosphere that makes the Live Aid stage feel like the last dying flame in his life, not just a simple performance. Also, the song "Bohemian Rhapsody" was a song that was dismissed by a record company executive in the film as a "weird, six-minute song" saying, "Who would listen to this on the radio?", so the climax of the song synergizes with Freddie Mercury's illness to create an even more dramatic effect.

In short, it shows the conflict over the song Bohemian Rhapsody, aka the trash song, and the dark personal conflict over Freddie Mercury's illness, and the climax is dramatic when the main character sings the legendary song 'Bohemian Rhapsody' at the last performance.

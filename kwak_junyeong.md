# Bohemian Rhapsody

In bohemian rhapsody, it is slowly implied that Freddie's health is getting worse throughout the movie. Scenes of coughing or struggling come out, and fatigue begins to appear on his face. In the beginning, however, the name of AIDS does not come out directly. Later in the movie, Freddie visits a hospital and hears "bad news" from the doctor. This scene is directed quietly and heavily, and although it does not specify exactly what kind of disease, it is understandable by the sexual orientation of the protagonist shown in the middle. Freddie calmly tells the Queen members that he has a disease to die of, and asks them to "don't sympathize with me." And he shows that he continues to affirm his life, saying, "We have to make music together."
The movie's climax, the 1985 Live Aid performance, happened before Freddie fell ill in real history, but the movie portrays Freddie in determination right after he was diagnosed with the disease. (It's actually a bit of an adaptation of the chronological order.) So the movie created an emotional tone so that the live-aid stage felt not just like a performance, but like the last flame that goes out for one's life.

# CODA 

In the film CODA, "Both Sides Now" plays a crucial role in portraying disability not as a mere deficiency, but as a bridge connecting different worlds. The scene where Ruby sings this song in sign language during her audition symbolically expresses the boundaries and communication challenges between her deaf parents and herself as a hearing child. Like the lyrics of the song, Ruby-who has experienced both sides of life: sound and silence, understanding and misunderstanding, loss and growth-conveys her heart to both her family and the world through her voice and her hands. Reflecting the filmâ€™s message that music can be appreciated even without hearing, "Both Sides Now" presents disability not as something to overcome, but as another way of perceiving the world through diverse senses and languages.

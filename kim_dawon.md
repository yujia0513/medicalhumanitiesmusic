# Extraordinary Attorney Woo(이상한 변호사 우영우)

"[A Whale in a Frame](https://youtu.be/DTsk6VNO9Wk?si=FNQt0Qsv3E2vX50n)" expresses the structural and order-oriented mindset of autism spectrum disorder through regular and repetitive piano rhythms, and the delicate development of string instruments that gradually accumulate indicates that Woo's emotions are not revealed but are expanding deep and complex inside. In addition, the dreamy and underwater-inspired sound texture symbolizes Woo's immersion and sensory excess when she thinks of whales in her imagination, and delicately reflects Woo's inner self, who is sensitive to stimuli and maintains her own rhythm and world by maintaining tension and concentration without dramatic changes in the entire music.
Additionally, this music can be seen in episode 4 when Woo Young-woo is emotionally focused while looking at a whale painting.

Example: The same disease is described in Barry Levinson's 1988 film [*Rain Man*](ahn_ire.md). The film Hans Zimmer's song "Leaving Wallbrook - On the Road".

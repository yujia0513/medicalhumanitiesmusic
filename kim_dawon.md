# 이상한 변호사 우영우

The track "The Whale" from Extraordinary Attorney Woo musically mirrors key characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Its simple yet repetitive piano motifs reflect the structured and patterned thinking often associated with ASD. The cautious, delicate flow of the melody parallels sensory sensitivities, while the gradual layering of string instruments symbolizes the complex, deeply rich inner world that may not be immediately visible externally. Occasional inserts of flute and subtle electronic sounds create a dreamlike quality, echoing how individuals with ASD might experience blurred boundaries between reality and imagination. The slow, floating rhythm captures a sense of moving through life at a different pace, detached from the conventional flow of social interaction.

Example: The same disease is described in Barry Levinson's 1988 film [*Rain Man*](ahn_ire.md). The film Hans Zimmer's song "Leaving Wallbrook - On the Road".

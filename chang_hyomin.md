# Me Before You

The film Me Before You portrays the life and choices of Will, a man living with quadriplegia, emphasizing that disability is not merely a physical limitation but a deeply emotional and existential challenge. The inserted track, [“Not Today”](https://youtu.be/6tz1_znrbmc?si=gamY7uK-dalpdFyL) by Imagine Dragons, features a soft, melancholic melody and the repeated lyric “not today,” effectively reflecting the complexity of Will’s inner state. 
The song plays during the emotionally charged scene in which Will prepares to say goodbye to Louisa and proceed with assisted suicide. The restrained music conveys the depth of emotions that words cannot fully express. Rather than directly depicting the disability itself, the music captures a layered human experience involving loss, despair, love, and farewell. 
However, Will’s decision to end his life also sparked ethical debates beyond his personal suffering—raising questions about autonomy, the value of life, and how society views disability. In this way, the film, supported by its emotional music, invites reflection not only on personal struggle but also on broader social perspectives regarding life with disability.

A comparable use of music to portray progressive physical disability can be found in [The Theory of Everything](lee_jiseong.md) (2014), which follows the life of physicist Stephen Hawking, who suffered from ALS. The film uses Jóhann Jóhannsson’s soft, atmospheric score to reflect Hawking’s emotional endurance and evolving inner world, much like how Me Before You uses “Not Today” to depict Will’s psychological struggle. Both works emphasize emotional and existential aspects of disability, allowing music to convey what the characters cannot express through physical action.

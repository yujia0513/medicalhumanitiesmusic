# Me Before You

In the film Me Before You, Imagine Dragons' "Not Today" is used in the scene after Will has chosen assisted death and passed away. Louisa travels to Paris, carrying Will's final message to "live well" in her heart. As she reads his letter and sits alone at a caf√©, "Not Today" plays in the background, subtly expressing her emotions of sorrow mixed with a tentative hope for a new beginning. The gentle melody and lyrics of the song create an atmosphere that accepts the pain of parting while offering the courage to move forward. Through this music, the film deepens the meaning of human resilience and recovery even in the face of extreme situations like living with quadriplegia.

Example: The same disease is describe in Olivier Nakache's 2011 film [*Untouchable*](heo_taeyoung.md). The film Ludovico Einaudi
's hit song "Fly".

# The theory of everything
Through a warm yet intricate orchestral composition, the music quietly and powerfully portrays the progression of illness, despair, and hope.
In particular, the orchestral melodies subtly reflect the inner struggles of a person fighting against disability, playing a crucial role in emphasizing the profound weight of confronting the reality of the disease.

This work is related to [*My Left Foot*](jiang_jingrong.md), which also deals with a biographical story of a person with a severe physical disability. Although ALS and cerebral palsy are different in cause and progression—ALS being a progressive adult-onset disease and cerebral palsy being a non-progressive congenital condition—both films portray protagonists with severe motor impairments who achieve remarkable accomplishments through determination and support. In both cases, music plays a vital role in expressing the characters' emotional states and their journeys of overcoming physical limitations.

# THE SUBSTANCE

In the movie, Elizabeth is a once-successful actress in her 50s who gets fired from hosting a fitness show simply because of her age. Afterward, she falls into despair over her aging self. However, she encounters a drug called "Substance," which gives her the chance to transform into a younger version of herself in her 20s. She names this younger self "Sue" and sends her to take over as the new host of the show. When Sue hosts the show for the first time, the song "Pump It Up" plays, and she performs intense moves that proudly show off her rejuvenated body.

# It's Okay, That's Love

In this song, the deep inner emotions of the character, the comfort and healing brought by love, and the process of pain and understanding experienced within a relationship are delicately captured. Jang Jae-yeol's schizophrenia is accompanied by confusion fluctuating between reality and fantasy, a sense of isolation from the world, and the resulting loneliness and pain. The ballad's lyrical melody and words serve as background music that metaphorically expresses the protagonist's vulnerable psychological state and the darkness within. Particularly, the complex emotions felt within the relationship with the person he loves (Ji Hae-soo) – such as anxiety alongside a sense of being saved, and the loneliness and hope on the journey towards acknowledging his illness and healing – are amplified and conveyed through the emotional depth inherent in the ballad genre. This plays a crucial role in making viewers empathize with Jang Jae-yeol's inner world and the difficulties he faces in reality, and cheer for his healing process.

# To Kill a Mockingbird

Elmer Bernstein’s main theme in To Kill a Mockingbird is composed of a simple and pure melody, symbolizing the innocence and vulnerability of marginalized individuals. This is particularly evident in the character of Tom Robinson, whose disabled left arm, caused by a childhood accident, makes him physically incapable of using it—an important fact ignored during his wrongful accusation of assault. [The music](https://youtu.be/_t98LWNwUhI?si=LBWfY2Ib_pMMW1wZ) reflects this helplessness through its gentle tempo, minimal orchestration, and delicate phrasing, all of which convey not only his physical limitations but also his emotional voicelessness in a society that refuses to listen. The gentle and poignant musical motif emphasizes his humanity and the broader emotional toll of prejudice. The film also subtly portrays Boo Radley (Arthur Radley) as a misunderstood figure. Although not explicitly diagnosed, his reclusive behavior and difficulty engaging with others suggest characteristics now associated with autism spectrum disorder—a condition largely misunderstood and rarely identified during the 1930s setting of the story, and even by the 1960s when the film was made. The film uses silence, minimal dialogue, and Boo's physical absence to express his isolation and internal struggle, drawing attention to how society fears what it fails to understand.

Example: The same disease is desribed in Barry Levinson's 1988 film [*Rain Man*](ahn_ire.md). The film contains Hans Zimmer's "Leaving Wallbrook - On the Road." The piece reflects the emotional complexity of living with autism, echoing the internal struggles and moments of clarity experienced by the protagonist.

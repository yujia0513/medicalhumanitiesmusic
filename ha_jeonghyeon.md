# To Kill a Mockingbird

Elmer Bernsteinâ€™s main theme is composed of a simple and pure melody, symbolizing the innocence and helplessness of marginalized individuals, particularly Tom Robinson, who bears a physical disability. The music gently and poignantly embraces his innocence, quietly highlighting the vulnerability of characters placed before the heavy obstacle of societal prejudice. In To Kill a Mockingbird, the people in Maycomb believe Boo(nickname of Arthur Radley) is a threat, but the reality is that they misunderstand him because he falls somewhere on the autism spectrum, which medical professionals do not thoroughly grasp in the 1960's.

Example: The same disease is desribed in Barry Levinson's 1988 film [*Rain Man*](ahn_ire.md). The film contains Hans Zimmer's "Leaving Wallbrook - On the Road." The piece reflects the emotional complexity of living with autism, echoing the internal struggles and moments of clarity experienced by the protagonist.

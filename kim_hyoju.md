# Notre-Dame de Paris

The refrain “Ah! Dieu! que le monde est injuste” (“Ah, God! How unfair the world is”) expresses Quasimodo’s anguished cry against the unjust reality he faces due to his physical deformities. “Mon visage est un masque” (“My face is a mask”) symbolizes the pain of having to hide his true self behind his grotesque appearance. In “Je me sens seul” (“I feel alone”), his profound sense of isolation is revealed, while “Pourquoi faut-il que je souffre ainsi?” (“Why must I suffer like this?”) conveys the deep sorrow of having his very existence denied. On stage, the actor playing Quasimodo portrays his physical suffering through a hunched posture, a twisted gait, and a cowering demeanor. His rough, coarse voice reflects his external hardships, contrasted with a soft, heartfelt singing voice that reveals his inner purity. The music begins gently and gradually intensifies, expanding Quasimodo’s pain beyond mere physical suffering into a desperate outcry against the world’s injustice. At the climax, his despair and repressed human yearning explode with overwhelming force, vividly conveying his agony deep into the hearts of the audience.

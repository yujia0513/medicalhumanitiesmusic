This novel, written by a deaf author and featuring a deaf main character, offers a vivid portrayal of deaf culture. Charlie, the protagonist, who had always believed she misunderstood music, begins to connect with it by feeling the anarchist punk music of her friend’s band through her heart. Ironically, she finds she can experience the music more deeply when she turns off the cochlear implant her mother forced her to wear in an attempt to make her live like a hearing person. Through Charlie—who grew up under an ableist society and was sent to a deaf school—we witness not only the ableism embedded in society and the failures of disability-centered medical care, but also the historical struggles and racial issues within American deaf culture.

The same disability is described in Sian Heder’s 2021 film [*Coda*](han_gahyeon.md) and Cho Sunho’s 2024 film [*Cheongseol(Hear Me)*](lee_yewon.md). In contrast to the novel, which deliberately avoids using music to reflect the perspective of Charlie, these works use music to highlight the main theme, deafness.

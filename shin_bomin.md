# Silver Linings Playbook

["My Cherie Amour" serves as a trigger for Pat, bringing back memories of his ex-wife.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P5d6AK8wPw) Whenever he hears the song, he impulsively erupts in anger, clearly revealing the emotional regulation difficulties characteristic of bipolar disorder. The music symbolically illustrates how a specific stimulus can have a profound and immediate impact on someone with a mental illness. Through this, the film conveys that pathological reactions are not merely a lack of rationality, but are deeply tied to emotional scars.

 The similar disease, Dysthymic disorder is described in Back sunwoo's 2024 drama [*Doctor Slump*](bae_sangjun.md). Low self-esteem and sense of helplessness, common depressive symptoms can appear in both Bipolar disorder and Dysthymic disorder. The song 'Not Alone' by HYNN is used to show protagonists' struggles and healing journeys in the drama.

"Ordinary Kid" highlights the movie's core message, 'The Ordinary Kid,' and musically expresses Ohgi's inner world and emotions. It is used as the background for Ohgi's birth and surgical scenes. Fast-changing chords and repetitive melodies symbolically represent Ohgi's inner conflict and growth process.

The similar disease is described in Michael Gracey’s 2017 film [*The Greatest Showman*](shin_minchul.md). The film’s song is “This Is Me”. It is similar in that it is a movie about people with physical deformities such as dwarfism, gigantism, and albinism.

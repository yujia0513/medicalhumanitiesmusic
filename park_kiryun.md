# Bohemian Rhapsody

"[*The Show Must Go On*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36ncula-IDw)" was worked on by Freddie Mercury during his dying period from AIDS, so the voice and lyrics of the song contain Freddie Mercury's desperation. In the film, the song was inserted into the ending credits after live-aid's grand performance, showing the desperation and passion of him, who was suffering from physical pain and weakness caused by AIDS. As for the lyrics, "Inside my heart is breaking, my makeup may be flaking, but my smile still stays on," shows how, even as his body deteriorated, he fiercely preserved his dignity as an artist. And the high pitch with a powerful voice portrays the struggle to transform the despair brought by illness into art while hiding the pain. Through this song, Freddie left behind a testament to his unwavering commitment to music and life even in the face of death.

The same disease, in [the same film](kwak_junyeong.md), is described with different music named "Bohemian Rhapsody". In this writing, AIDS is described through Freddie Mercury's performance 'Live Aid'.

Park Sang Young's 2024 film [*Love in the Big City*](yum_jihyeon.md) also describes HIV infection. Through SURAN's music "Erotic Joke", the writing deals with the social suffering of HIV.

# Nymphomaniac

In chapter 5, Seligman starts the conversation with, “It's something I've been listening to a lot lately.” and introduces Bach’s <Ich ruf zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ>. He explains: “This piece has three voices: the bass voice, the second voice played with the left hand, and first voice played with the right hand. (…) And together, these three voices create the polyphony.”
Joe immediately maps her nymphomaniac experience onto this musical form. “Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as... someone who can't get enough, and therefore, has sex with many different people. Well, that, of course, is true, but if I'm to be honest, I see it precisely as the sum of all these different sexual experiences. So in that way, I have only one lover.” She then describes three lovers—F, G and Jerome—in turn.
Joe explains that they correspond to the bass, middle, and upper voices, respectively. F, she says, was “monotonous, predictable, and ritualistic,” yet also “the foundation.” As she finishes this point, a single low phrase pulses beneath his frame. She continues: G was the only partner she both had to—and wanted to—wait for. He moved with jaguar-like grace and unpredictability, keeping her suspended between tension and release. When her account of him ends, a brief alto line floats over his image. She concludes with Jerome—“the secret ingredient to sex,” which, for her, is love. As she speaks, a rapid soprano run glides across the screen.
After each brief musical cue, the film pulls back into a split-screen montage: F on the left, G on the right, and Jerome in the center. At that moment, all three musical lines are heard together(original piece). The film synchronises the figures’ movements with the score, framing Joe’s claim—that many sexual experiences fuse into a single lover—in both sound and image. The scene frames nymphomania as a tidy polyphonic order, yet it also shows how desire breaks intimacy into interchangeable proxies—partners reduced to bare initials like “F” and “G”—so the relationship stays abstract and never touches the Real.

In musical Notre-Dame de Paris, Quasimodo’s body crystallises into one grotesque mass, so [*hyper-visible*](kim_hyoju.md) that every gaze must collide with its “monstrous” excess. Joe’s body, by contrast, scatters into erotic shards—encountered by herself and by others only as isolated acts or organs—so that no coherent figure ever comes into focus. One body is oppressively present, pinned to a single outline; the other is perpetually absent, dissolved into the promise of pleasure. Together they trace the two poles of deviant embodiment.

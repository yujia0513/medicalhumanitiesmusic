# Nymphomaniac

In [chapter 5 The Little Organ School](https://youtu.be/dIvuZ1bmrWs?si=IfHkbCZW3tDC15q7), Seligman starts the conversation with, “It's something I've been listening to a lot lately.” and introduces Bach’s chorale prelude <Ich ruf zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ>. “This piece has three voices: the bass voice, the second voice played with the left hand, and first voice played with the right hand. (…) And together, these three voices create the polyphony.”
Joe immediately maps her nymphomaniac experience onto this musical form. “Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as... someone who can't get enough, and therefore, has sex with many different people. Well, that, of course, is true, but if I'm to be honest, I see it precisely as the sum of all these different sexual experiences. So in that way, I have only one lover.”

An intellectually elegant metaphor seems to be born. The film supports Joe's claim with a seductive formalism. She maps F, the "monotonous foundation," to the bass line. G, the "unpredictable" partner, is assigned to the alto line. Jerome, who was "love," corresponds to the brilliant soprano. These three melodies are finally integrated into a perfect ensemble within a [split-screen montage(**Includes sexual content**)](https://vimeo.com/1036892452?share=copy). In this moment, her argument appears audiovisually complete.

Yet, this elegant metaphor falls apart when faced with the evidence she herself provides. True polyphony is a harmony of unique, irreplaceable voices. Joe’s partners, in contrast, are reduced to anonymous initials like 'F' and 'G'. They are treated as replaceable parts, not as individuals. This dehumanization proves the history of her body's failure to achieve satisfaction and intimacy. A true 'ensemble' cannot be built from non-unique parts. Faced with this contradiction, the beautiful narrative constructed by the mind can no longer be defended.

The fact that this inherently flawed metaphor is directed with such aesthetic perfection gives rise to irony, and the power of this scene comes from that ironic failure. The sublime music does not save the chaotic life. It functions as a cynical mirror that reflects its emptiness. Yet, what is revealed at the end of this deconstruction is not mere cynicism, but a truth of a deeper dimension. It is not the 'perfect harmony' Joe intended to show. Instead, it is the more honest truth that her self is constituted by 'the sum of all failed relationships.' In the end, this 'failed ensemble' becomes a paradoxical portrait, recording a wounded human existence—one where relationships remain abstract and never touch the Real—more truthfully than the beautiful lie of a perfect harmony ever could.

<img src="./jang_seongwon_img.png" alt="This image visualizes a structure of self-alienation disguised as a harmony of pleasure, revealing a state in which Joe’s body is ultimately denied the possibility of becoming “a person.” Her body is fragmented into pieces, forming an illusion of wholeness while in fact representing the absence of any real totality. The silhouettes in the background can be read as anonymized proxies of her past partners—traces of the gazes that consumed her body—symbolizing a structure where intimacy is replaced by abstracted desire." style="width:35%;" />

In musical Notre-Dame de Paris, Quasimodo’s body crystallises into one grotesque mass, so [*hyper-visible*](kim_hyoju.md) that every gaze must collide with its “monstrous” excess. Joe’s body, by contrast, scatters into erotic shards—encountered by herself and by others only as isolated acts or organs—so that no coherent figure ever comes into focus. One body is oppressively present, pinned to a single outline; the other is perpetually absent, encountered only in fragments that refuse to add up to a person. Together they trace the two poles of deviant embodiment.

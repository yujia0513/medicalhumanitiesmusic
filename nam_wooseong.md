# CODA

In the movie, when music depicts a disability, it focuses on details by emphasizing "non-existent sounds" or making people experience "absence of sound." For example, when Ruby sings, the audience suddenly encounters a scene where the sound is completely turned off, and then the audience only sees her singing with their eyes and experiences the world without music that their families feel. This silence is not just silence, but also serves to show the situation in which the family struggles to feel Ruby's passion or emotions.

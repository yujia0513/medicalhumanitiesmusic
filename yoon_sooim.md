# It’s Okay, That’s Love(괜찮아, 사랑이야)

It is drama, created by Noh Hee-kyung.

This drama is a work that announced the disease called schizophrenia. In particular, the main content is the story of a person who accepts the protagonist and embraces the pain while the protagonist acknowledges his schizophrenia and receives treatment, and at this time, it is a song that reveals the hearts of those parties well. It shows that even the most ordinary people do not know and live with emotional illness. This song flows out of the scene where the main characters silently confess their true feelings, and it can be seen that it is a song that reveals the meaning that love is not about changing the other person, but about staying with that person's pain.

Example: There are similarities with my data in that it is a ballad OST for Korean drama called [*Doctor Slump*](bae_sangjun.md).

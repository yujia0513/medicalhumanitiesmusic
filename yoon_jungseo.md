# Sound of Metal

Sound of Metal (2019) shows a story through music and sound. It starts with loud metal music, then moves to quiet sounds as the main character [loses his hearing](park_jinpyo.md). In the end, silence becomes a way for him to [find peace inside himself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQ3zy8iYtk)

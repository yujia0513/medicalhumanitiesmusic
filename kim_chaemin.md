# A Silent Voice

In animation, voice serves as a crucial medium for revealing characters' inner states, while music tangibly articulates illness and disability. In A Silent Voice, unstable rhythms and fractured melodies reflect psychological anxiety and isolation, and the tremors in vocal expression deepen the audience's sensory understanding of the character’s pain. Notably, [the song 「恋をしたのは」 (Koi wo Shita no wa)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAzNLC1Lu7Q) enhances this depiction, supporting the protagonist’s emotional arc by conveying longing and vulnerability in moments where verbal communication falters. While the voice plays a powerful expressive role, the film also subtly acknowledges its limitations within the context of deafness. Rather than portraying hearing loss as mere absence, the work suggests an alternative sensory richness—what some describe as "Deaf gain"—highlighting how different modes of perception can reshape narrative and empathy.

# Beethoven Virus


Beethoven Virus (2008, MBC) is a South Korean television drama centered on music. The story follows Kang Mae (played by Ji Jin-hee), a perfectionist conductor, as he clashes and harmonizes with various amateur musicians. The drama portrays characters who experience physical or psychological illnesses or disabilities, using music as a lens to explore their internal struggles and healing.

The similar condition, psychological trauma, is explored in Shin Bomin’s analysis of David O. Russell’s 2012 film [*Silver Linings Playbook*](shin_bomin.md). The protagonist, who suffers from bipolar disorder, experiences intense emotional responses triggered by music—specifically, My Cherie Amour by Stevie Wonder. This reflects how certain sounds can evoke suppressed emotional pain.

Likewise, [Beethoven Virus portrays characters dealing with hearing loss and deep psychological wounds.](https://youtu.be/cep8Ru4TL4k?si=RJ6CZzAS0lDtlUtG) Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 acts as a powerful emotional medium, helping the characters confront their inner turmoil and find healing through music. Both works highlight how music can uncover buried trauma and serve as a path toward emotional restoration.

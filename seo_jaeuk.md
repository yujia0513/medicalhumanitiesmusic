# A Beautiful Mind

The music is used in the car chase sequence and consists of short, sharp strings and irregular percussive rhythms that create tension for the audience by driving anxiety and confusion, which encourages the audience to accept the schizophrenic protagonist's hallucinations as real.

The film is also linked to Barry Levinson's 1988 film [*Rain Man*](ahn_ire.md), which also tells the biographical story of a character with a severe neurological disorder. While schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder are fundamentally different conditions - the former involves a disconnect from reality, while the latter is characterized by inborn cognitive differences - both films showcase protagonists who perceive the world in a different way than societal norms, and who develop remarkable insights despite their limitations. Music in particular serves as a powerful medium to convey their inner struggles, moments of epiphany, and confrontations with societal misconceptions.

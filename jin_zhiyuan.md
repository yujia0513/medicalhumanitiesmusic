# Hilary and Jackie

In the movie, Elgar's Cello Concerto is used to express Jacqueline Dupre's emotions and her struggle with illness. As her multiple sclerosis worsened, this music became a symbol of her inner struggle and loneliness. It not only showcases her talent and passion as a musician, but also reflects her deep pain and helplessness in losing her abilities and undergoing life-changing changes. The sadness and reflection in the music deepen the film's emotional depth, reinforcing themes of loss and helplessness.

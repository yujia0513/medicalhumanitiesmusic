# Cheongseol(Hear Me)

 The film Cheongseol portrays hearing impairment not as a deficiency, but as an expansion of perception—a concept often referred to as Deaf Gain, [with the song "Four Season"](https://youtu.be/PO6VyzBZWcI?si=W61sXzlxYA1ndZGV). Rather than focusing on what is lost, the film reveals how silence can awaken a deeper emotional sensitivity and richer interpersonal connection. The main theme song, Season (Gyejeol), sung by No Yoon-seo and her younger sister—both portrayed as hearing-impaired—serves as a key emotional bridge. Its soft piano melody and gradual string layering gently express the arc of emotions that pass between the characters: loneliness, hope, affection, and unspoken understanding. One especially moving scene, where the sisters share a quiet moment in a sunlit room with Season playing in the background, captures this perfectly. Without dialogue, the music becomes their voice, translating silence into emotion. The piece doesn’t just accompany the film—it speaks for it. In doing so, Season affirms that sound is not essential for emotional truth, and that the absence of hearing can lead to the emergence of other expressive forms. Through this musical lens, Cheongseol invites the audience into a new emotional world where connection blooms in silence.

Example: The same disease is described in Sian Heder's 2021 film [*CODA*](han_gahyeon.md). The film contains Joni mitchell's song "Both sides now".

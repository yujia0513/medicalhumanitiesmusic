# Doctor Slump

A ballad combining emotional piano melodies with powerful vocals, “Not Alone” conveys a message of comfort and solidarity. The lyrics repeat phrases such as “You are not alone” and “I will be by your side,” providing consolation to those enduring psychological hardships.

The ost 'Not Alone' by HYNN delicately reflect the emotional struggles of depression and burnout experienced by the protagonists in Doctor Slump. Through gentle melodies and heartfelt lyrics, this song emphasize that even amid isolation and despair, emotional connection and mutual support can facilitate healing. The musical elements reinforce the drama’s core themes of recovery and resilience, enabling viewers to deeply empathize with the characters’ journeys.

A similar example is discussed in [*The End of the F***ing World*](park_dahyun.md). That piece also explores emotional numbness and isolation through minimalistic music. In particular, the restrained vocals and repetitive guitar riffs reflect the psychological detachment of the character James, resonating with the themes of burnout and depression seen in *Doctor Slump*.

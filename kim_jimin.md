# keys to the heart 

In the movie Keys to the Heart, Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5 is used as an important piece of music to show Jin-tae's autism and savant syndrome. The fast and intense rhythm represents his inner world, moving between uncontrollable emotions and sudden bursts of genius. Through this music, the movie shows Jin-tae’s disability not as something lacking, but as a special world full of unique senses and talents, helping the audience understand and feel the beauty of his life in a warm and touching way.

Example: The two works explore similar themes through different conditions—savant syndrome and schizophrenia. {*A Beautiful Mind*}(lee_eunbi.md). Keys to the Heart uses Brahms’ Hungarian Dance No. 5 to portray the complex emotions and genius of a character with autism and savant syndrome, illustrating a world where unique sensitivity and talent coexist. On the other hand, A Beautiful Mind expresses the inner pain of schizophrenia through the song “All Love Can Be,” while also highlighting enduring love and hope. In both cases, the films present disability or mental illness not as mere deficiency, but as a unique emotional world filled with human beauty and depth.

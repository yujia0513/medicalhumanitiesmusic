# The Greatest Showman

["This Is Me"](https://youtu.be/CjxugyZCfuw?si=BOoXxYIdEXs2kf-V) is a song used in the movie The Greatest Showman during a scene where characters with disabilities affirm and proudly express their existence. Sung by individuals who bear social stigmas due to their appearance, identity or physical differences, the song serves as a message of liberation from social marginalization. The film effectively portrays the characters' journey of reclaiming their agency and confronting societal prejudices. Through the lyrics of the song, they reveal that they are no longer "freaks," but individuals who confidently stand on stage as human beings. For example, in the lines "When the sharpest words wanna cut me down / I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out," the lyrics express a strong determination to resist hurtful criticism and overcome negativity. The next lines, "I am brave, I am bruised / I am who I'm meant to be, this is me," reflect a proud acceptance of both strength and past pain, affirming the singerâ€™s identity with confidence and self-respect.

The depiction of the main character with a physical disability is similar to that in the movie [*To Kill a Mockingbird*](ha_jeonghyeon.md). The film's song is "Theme from to kill a mockingbird". It is also similar in that it portrays the character who is hurt by social prejudice.

# strange case of Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde

This piece illustrates Dr. Jekyllâ€™s emphasis on his rational identity, reflecting his conviction that he can suppress and regulate his primal instincts and impulses through scientific experimentation. However, this very moment marks the inception of awakening his darker inner self, known as Hyde.

Example: A similar disease(mental disorder) is described in Belle's 2021 film [*The Dragon and the Freckled Princess*](huh_yejin.md).

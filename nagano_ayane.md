# One Litre of Tears

The theme song of 1 Litre of Tears, [“Only Human” by K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqsdRNiQOtE), beautifully represents the emotional tone of the series and captures the inner world of the protagonist, Aya Ikeuchi. As Aya gradually loses her physical abilities due to a degenerative disease, the song gently but powerfully expresses her silent determination to continue living as herself. The delicate blend of piano and strings reflects her sorrow, internal conflict, and unwavering will to keep going—leaving a lasting emotional impression on the viewer.

In scenes where the song is featured—whether in the music video or as an insert track—the music complements moments when Aya struggles to express herself in words. Her fear of losing control of her body, her gratitude toward her family, and her private emotions are delicately communicated through music. This allows viewers to go beyond the image of a “sick girl” and connect with Aya as a full, complex human being.

The drama 1 Litre of Tears (2005, Fuji TV) is based on the real diary of Aya Kitō, a girl diagnosed with spinocerebellar degeneration at the age of 15. The series portrays her daily life as she experiences increasing physical limitations, but also highlights her emotional strength, her will to learn and grow, and the deep bonds she shares with family and friends. Rather than focusing solely on her decline, the drama honors her resilience and the richness of her lived experience.

A similar work with a comparable tone and message is [*Extraordinary Attorney Woo*](park_hyowon.md). Through the story of a protagonist with autism spectrum disorder, the drama uses music and thoughtful direction to express emotional depth and complexity. Both works reject the notion of disability as merely tragic, instead highlighting difference as an essential and dignified part of human diversity.

Both Aya and Woo Young-woo fall outside conventional ideas of what is “normal,” but each finds her own way to engage with the world and gently challenge the biases around her. Their stories show that living with illness or disability is not a misfortune, but one of many valid ways of being. These works offer powerful messages about empathy, inclusion, and embracing diversity in human life.

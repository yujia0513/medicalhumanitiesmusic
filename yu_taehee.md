# Coda

In CODA, Ruby is torn between her deaf parents—who rely on her as their link to the hearing world—and her dream of becoming a singer. At first, she sees her path clearly, but as time passes, she’s confronted with the painful reality that she may not be able to fully embrace both her family and her future. This emotional conflict is beautifully reflected in the lyrics of "Both Sides Now." Especially the line “I really don't know life at all” conveys a deep sense of emptiness and resignation, capturing Ruby's growing confusion and emotional turmoil. The gentle rise and fall of the melody, along with Ruby's restrained yet deeply emotional vocal delivery, enhance the vulnerability in this moment. Her voice doesn’t just sing—it wavers with doubt, longing, and love, subtly mirroring her inner struggle. If the lyrics had also directly touched on her unique situation—being the only hearing member in a deaf family—it might have made that emotional connection even stronger. Nonetheless, the music’s tender atmosphere evokes images of isolation, open skies, and unspoken bonds—visual metaphors for Ruby’s inner world that help the audience feel the tension between silence and sound, duty and desire.[the scene where the song play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgKvP0O0nyI)

Example: A movie similar to CODA is Sound of Metal (2019).Both films center around deafness and explore themes of identity and community through the experience of losing or living without sound. They also share a commitment to authentic representation, including casting deaf actors in key roles.

# coda

In CODA, the family members are deaf, and only the main character, Ruby, can hear. [In the scene where Ruby sings on stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgKvP0O0nyI), the film turns off the sound, letting the audience experience the silent world her family lives in. By doing this, music becomes a bridge that helps people understand and connect with a different world. It shows that disability is not just a limit to overcome, but a different way of living. This perspective has inspired empathy and respect toward those who live with disabilities.

A film that deals with the same hearing impairment. In the film [*A Silent Voice*](jin_guangxin.md), the main character has a hearing impairment that gradually worsens. In contrast, in the film CODA, it is the protagonist’s family—excluding the protagonist herself—that has hearing impairments. This difference can be seen as a key distinction between the two films.

# coda

In CODA, the family members are deaf, and only the main character, Ruby, can hear. In the scene where Ruby sings on stage, the film turns off the sound, letting the audience experience the silent world her family lives in. By doing this, music becomes a bridge that helps people understand and connect with a different world. It shows that disability is not just a limit to overcome, but a different way of living.

A film that deals with the same hearing impairment. In the film [*A Silent Voice*](jin_guangxin.md), the main character has a hearing impairment that gradually worsens. In contrast, in the film CODA, it is the protagonist’s family—excluding the protagonist herself—that has hearing impairments. This difference can be seen as a key distinction between the two films.

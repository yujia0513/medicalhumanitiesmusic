# Rain Man

People with autism are known to find a sense of stability through consistent routines and repetition. Although their behavior may appear chaotic or somewhat erratic to outside observers, they operate according to their own internal rules and structure. In the movie Rain Man, [This piece of music(Leaving Wallbrook-On the Road)](https://youtu.be/gEX3bBjz44s?si=VR_Zktla-0bqEbfv) appears in the scene where the protagonist, Charlie, leaves the Wallbrook institution and sets off on a journey with his brother, Raymond. The simple and repetitive melody musically expresses the repetitive and compulsive behaviors experienced by Charlie, who has autism, serving as a device that provides psychological comfort to the protagonist.

The music mainly features piano, soft synthesizers, with occasional acoustic guitar and flute, characterized by a slow and repetitive tempo. The simple, repeating melody combined with steady rhythms and gentle harmonies conveys a sense of psychological stability and comfort amid Charlieâ€™s inner turmoil. The soft flute melodies and warm tones of the acoustic guitar add warmth to the music, delivering a sense of calm and solace that resonates with the audience, reflecting the comfort found in repetitive routines.

A drama that deals with the same disability is [*Extraordinary Attorney Woo*](kim_jaehee.md) Just as Rain Man has a genius-level ability with numbers, Woo Young-woo excels as a lawyer due to her incredible memorization skills. The music titled "Imagination" from this drama beautifully captures the clear and blue imagination that Woo Young-woo possesses.

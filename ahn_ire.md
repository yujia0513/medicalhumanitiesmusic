# Rain Man

People with autism are known to find a sense of stability through consistent routines and repetition. Although their behavior may appear chaotic or somewhat erratic to an outside observer, they operate according to their own internal rules and structure. This piece of music appears in a scene where the main character leaves an institution and sets off on a journey with his brother. The melody is simple and repeats continuously, reflecting the repetitive nature of autism, which serves as a device to express the psychological comfort it brings the protagonist.
A drama that deals with the same disability is [*Extraordinary Attorney Woo*](kim_jaehee.md) Just as Rain Man has a genius-level ability with numbers, Woo Young-woo excels as a lawyer due to her incredible memorization skills. The music titled "Imagination" from this drama beautifully captures the clear and blue imagination that Woo Young-woo possesses.

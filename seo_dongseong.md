# The Theory of Everything

Jóhannsson’s music uses gentle piano motifs and swelling strings to evoke both the vulnerability and inner strength of Hawking as he faces physical decline.The score’s hopeful yet melancholic tone mirrors the persistence of intellect and love despite the progression of disease, allowing the audience to feel both the sorrow and inspiration in Hawking’s story.


Gentle piano refers to a musical technique where soft and delicate piano melodies are used to convey deep emotions and atmosphere through simplicity and subtlety.
This gentle piano style is prominently featured in both The Theory of Everything and [*Untouchable*](heo_taeyoung.md), expressing the characters’ vulnerability, inner strength, and the beauty of life with sensitivity.
In [*Untouchable*](heo_taeyoung.md), Ludovico Einaudi’s “Fly” is a prime example, using gentle piano to warmly and hopefully depict moments when the protagonists forget about disability and fully enjoy their sense of freedom.

# Untouchable

Ludovico Einaudi's Fly delicately depicts the fragility of human existence and the strength that overcomes it through repetitive patterns and gradual ascents without directly explaining illness or disability. The simple and gentle piano melody that begins gently approaches as if to carefully embrace life again, and the gradually increasing rhythm carefully builds up the will to overcome physical limitations. This song appears in the movie Untouchable when Driss drives a car through the city with Philippe in a wheelchair. The camera focuses on the two people in the fast-moving car, and the light yet delicate rhythm of Fly fills the background, momentarily forgetting about their disability and enjoying freedom, further highlighting the laughter and sense of being alive. Therefore, this music does not express sadness or sympathy, but quietly but powerfully shows the light flight of the human spirit that overcomes disability and runs through life.

The same disease is described in Thea Sharrockâ€™s 2016 film [*Me Before You*] (Kim_minjung.md). Me Before You and The Intouchables both revolve around the lives of quadriplegics, but they differ greatly in how they portray and deal with the disease. Will in Me Before You becomes paralyzed from the neck down after a motorcycle accident, loses his will to live, and decides to commit assisted suicide. He briefly finds hope through his relationship with his caregiver, Louisa, but ultimately chooses to take his own life. On the other hand, Philippe in The Intouchables becomes paralyzed from the neck down after a paragliding accident, but he regains his vitality after meeting his free-spirited caregiver, Driss, and he accepts his disability through humor and human relationships. Both films realistically portray the physical difficulties of quadriplegic life, but they convey contrasting messages: Me Before You is emotional and tragic, while The Intouchables looks at the disease from a bright and cheerful perspective.

# August rush

"This Time" doesn't directly address disability, Since it is used in the symbolic scene of the journey of overcoming the psychological and environmental obstacles of the protagonist through music, it can be said to be a song that is meaningful enough to explore the relationship between disability and art. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zynpXcAhq8c&ab_channel=PaulPonce) This song is a quiet confession sung by someone with a wound, opening up for the first time, and a little consolation to all deficiencies who want love.

There is a similarity that people with mental illness do music

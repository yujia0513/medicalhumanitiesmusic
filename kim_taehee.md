# 말아톤(film maraton)

“Run, Cho-won” is featured in the film’s final marathon sequence, portraying a powerful moment in which the protagonist, who has autism spectrum disorder, overcomes his limitations and connects with the world. Composer Kim Joon-sung uses a delicate interplay of piano and strings to express Cho-won’s inner tension, deep concentration, and eventual sense of freedom. Beyond mere storytelling, the music conveys the complexity of Cho-won’s emotions, offering a non-stereotypical perspective on disability. Rather than marking him as "special" or "different," the music respectfully reveals his unique emotional world and subtly reminds us that his feelings and experiences are not unlike those of anyone else. It transforms the perception of disability into a different but equally valid way of experiencing life.

The ballad featured in the drama It’s Okay, That’s Love delicately portrays the emotional journey of Jang Jae-yeol, who suffers from schizophrenia. Its lyrical melody and emotionally charged vocals express the confusion he experiences between reality and illusion, his deep sense of loneliness, and the complex emotions within his romantic relationship. The music serves as a medium that conveys his vulnerability and his hope for healing.

This method of expressing psychological distress and emotional depth through music is closely related to the film Marathon, which I analyzed separately.[*It's Okay, That's Love*](do_gwanwoo.md) Although Marathon deals with autism—a different subject—it shares a common approach in using music to reveal the protagonist’s inner world. In particular, the piece Run, Cho-won communicates Cho-won’s emotions without words, allowing the audience to feel his experience. The music functions not just as background, but as a narrative device that adds depth to the character’s emotional arc.

 # Weird lawyer Woo Youngwoo

 Having a genius brain and autism spectrum at the same time, Young-woo is quirky and out of the blue, but solid, straight and energetic. "Imagination" is the source of Young-woo's careful steps forward without stopping at his own pace. This song invites everyone to the blue imagination that goes beyond their thoughts and limits. This song allows us to be with this imagination that supports Young-woo and imagines a more transparent and clear world.
The song is a musical composition of Woo Young-woo's inner world and emotions, especially depicting the experiences of people with autism spectrum disorder in detail. Through this song, music director Noh Young-sim said he wanted to convey "a comfort to everyone who tries to communicate and live with people in the world." This is a musical expression of the difficulties of communication experienced by people with disabilities and their desire to connect with the world despite this.
 
Example : The same disease is discribed in In Shik Yoo's 2022 drama [*Weird lawyer Woo Youngwoo*](park_hyowon.md). A hit song from the drama "Weird Lawyer Woo Young-woo‚Äù is Beyond My Dreams.

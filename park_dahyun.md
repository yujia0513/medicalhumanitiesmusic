# The_end_of_the_f***ing_world

This song is part of the soundtrack for the Netflix series The End of the F**ing World, and it musically expresses the protagonist James’s sense of emotional isolation and numbness. The restrained emotions and simple structure of the track effectively reflect James’s psychological state, allowing the audience to gain a deeper understanding of his inner world. It uses slow, repetitive guitar riffs and weary vocals to convey James's growing sense of emotional isolation from both the world and himself. The song captures James’s internal numbness and emptiness—what appears as psychopathic tendencies—by emphasizing a sluggish, drained musical flow. This mirrors his conflicted desire for human connection while instinctively keeping his distance. The music subtly highlights that James's "illness" is not rooted in malice but in the pain of being unable to feel.

The same disease Antisocial personality disorder is described in Lynne Ramsay's 2011 film [*We Need to Talk About Kevin*](han_yeonsoo.md).The music used in the film is Buddy Holly's "Everyday", and it similarly conveys the protagonist’s antisocial personality disorder and psychopathic tendencies through its use. Another shared aspect is that the protagonist is a minor, and their antisocial traits are shown to be connected to their parents.

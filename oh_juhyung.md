# marathon

This is the music that plays when Cho-won, who has autistic disorder and the intelligence of a 5-year-old, runs a marathon. At first, it expresses a confident start with a cheerful sound. It also expresses Cho-won's innocence with the intelligence of a 5-year-old through a bright melody. Then, in the scene where Cho-won gets tired, the melody turns dark and expresses his frustration. However, Cho-won starts running again when someone gives him a chocolate pie, and after that, it dramatically expresses him completing the marathon with a more confident and powerful rhythm than before.

The same disease is described in Barry Levinson's 1988 film [*Rain man*](ahn_ire.md). According to the explanation of this article, autistic patients find a sense of stability in repetition. When looking at Run Cho-won in this aspect, it can be seen that Run Cho-won also has a repetitive melody. Although the melody changes from time to time, there is a continuous melody.

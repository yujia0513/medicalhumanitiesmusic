# marathon

This is the [*music*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nM9hL95LzA) that plays when Cho-won, who has autistic disorder and the intelligence of a 5-year-old, runs a marathon. At first, it expresses a confident start with a cheerful sound. It also expresses Cho-won's innocence with the intelligence of a 5-year-old through high notes and fast tempos. Then, in the scene where Cho-won gets tired, the melody turns dark and expresses his frustration. However, Cho-won starts running again when someone gives him a chocolate pie, which Cho-won likes from beginning of a film, and after that, it dramatically expresses him completing the marathon with a more confident and powerful rhythm than before. And in this scene, Cho-won drops the Choco Pie he receives on the floor, and shows pure enthusiasm to give up his favorite stuff to complete the marathon.

The same disease is described in Barry Levinson's 1988 film [*Rain man*](ahn_ire.md). According to the explanation of this article, autistic patients find a sense of stability in repetition. When looking at Run Cho-won in this aspect, it can be seen that Run Cho-won also has a repetitive melody. Although the melody changes from time to time, there is a continuous melody.

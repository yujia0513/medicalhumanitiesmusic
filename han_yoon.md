# Still Alice

In Still Alice(2014), directed by Richard Glatzer, This music(If I Had a Boat) expresses the finiteness of life with a soft yet lonely tone of the sadness and loneliness of the protagonist who loses her memory.

The same disease is described in Hwan Min Oh's 2021 TV Drama [*Navillera*](yeo_inwook.md) The TV Drama Min Kim's song "My Day" is also a song that depicts the main character's Alzheimer's disease in the TV drama Navillera. My Day expresses the protagonist's willingness to challenge his past dreams in order to regain the memories of the past that are gradually disappearing.
